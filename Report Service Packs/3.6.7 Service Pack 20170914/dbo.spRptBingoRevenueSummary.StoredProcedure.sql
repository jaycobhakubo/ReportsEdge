--
-- BJS 05/31/2011: US1851 new report
-- BJS 06/17/2011: DE8676 session number
-- bjs 06/21/2011: missing bingo sales
-- LJL 06/23/2011: Removed voided payouts from result set

-- 2012.04.05 jkn: Adding support for returning data based on a fiscal date
--		not only the date range
-- TMP 01/19/2013: Removed the concession and merchandise product types.
-- jkn 03/14/2013: Changed the size of the session numbers from TINYINT to INT.  
--	This caused an issue during the NV audit when paper was issued to session 
--	number 8877 and this overflowed the session number buffer, the size was
--	then increased to and INT and all is well now.
-- TMP 07/16/2013: US2702 Changed the payout calculations to use different joins.
--  Before NULL values in Results.SessionNumber were being joined to the SessionPlayed
--  table where it did not find a match. As the SessionPlayed table grows so did the time it
--  took to run the stored procedure.
-- TMP 01/03/2014: Removed the Fiscal Date setting so that the report uses the calendar year Jan 1 to Dec 31.
--                 The fiscal date global setting is not supported.
-- TMP 01/03/2014: Changed the report to use the Session Summary table to improve the speed of the report.
--                 Requires the data to be generated in the Session Summary module in order to populate the report. 
-- 20150925(knc): Coupon sale added.
-- 2015.10.02: DE12771 Fixed issue with when there are no coupon sales no data would be returned
-- 2016.02.03 tmp: US4428/US4522 - Added the validaiton sales to Bingo Sales calculation.
-- 2016.11.08 tmp: DE13318 - Where @SessionID and/or condition was missing ().
-- 2017.09.14 tmp: DE13751 - Check if the SessionPlayedID was overridden. Fixed an issue where it could return
--                           two rows for a single session.
